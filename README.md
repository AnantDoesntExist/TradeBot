# TradeBot
An algorithmic trading bot based on the Stochastic Oscillator, Average True Range and Money Flow Index. Coded in Python.  Logs in google sheets. You will have to setup the google service account and the login with your brokerage. For logging in I suggest simply searching up how to login into (brokerage name ex. Binance) with (brokerage name) api. . For google service account setup I suggest this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ssigWmExak . You will also need 3 api keys for TAAPI.io . I used my alt accounts for that. And one Nomics key for checking prices. Adjust anything in <> signs.
